Graduate in Videogame Design and Development, a degree in Computer Engineering. My profile is completely programming, oriented to artificial intelligence and, specifically, to the resolution of combinatorial optimization problems. I am currently studying a Master in Artificial Intelligence Research at Universidad Menéndez Pelayo in collaboration with AEPIA.
